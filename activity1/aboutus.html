<h1><strong><center>ABOUT US</strong></center></h1>

	<P>Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
	I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
	She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
	It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone
	And I'll be gone, gone tonight</p>

	<p>The ground beneath my feet is open wide
	The way that I been holdin' on too tight
	With nothin' in between
	The story of my life, I take her home
	I drive all night to keep her warm</p>

	<p>And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
	The story of my life, I give her hope
	I spend her love until she's broke inside
	The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
	</p>
